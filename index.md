Welcome to Neurath's boat,
a blog about projects I am involved in,
computational and analytical tools I find useful,
and "thoughts in progress".

The goals of this blog are for it to serve as:

* a personal archive, to avoid forgetting and to organize my thoughts
* a reference for other people who ask me stuff, following David Robinson's
advise: [^1]

But who is Neurath and what about his boat?
It may be useful to first provide some context in order to better appreciate the
concept.


## The foundations of knowledge

How do we know?
This is the subject of a branch of philosophy called
[epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology).
A core question in epistemology is
whether all of our knowledge comes from experience or
if some knowledge can be acquired independently of experience,
for example through reason.
But is that possible?
Empiricists like
[David Hume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume)
would argue that all knowledge proceeds from experience.
But do we need knowledge from experience to know
something that appears to be necessarily true,
such as that $7 + 5 = 12$ ?
If so, it remains possible that $7 + 5$ may not be equal to $12$
and that sounds counter-intuitive.
[Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant)
came to argue that
the foundations of knowledge are based on necessary truths
that can be known as true without experience,
such as propositions about space, time, and substance.
But then all knowledge must be based on
the metaphysical belief of their existence.

In the early twentieth century
an influential philosophical movement called
[logical positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism)
attempted to provide a framework within which
each proposition would
either be necessarily true based on rules of formal logic
or would be subject to verification based on experience,
thus doing away with Kant's metaphysical assumptions.
But where would logic be founded on
and how could the verification criterion itself be established?

Among the critics of logical positivism was
[Willard van Orman Quine]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine)
who pointed out that the distinction between
necessarily true propositions on the one hand
and propositions that are verifiable through experience on the other
was itself arbitrary;
an article of metaphysical faith,
the very thing that the positivists were trying to avoid.
Instead, Quine proposed the doctrine of confirmation holism ([Figure 1](#Fig1))
according to which
the whole body of empirical knowledge is tested with every new observation
and no part of it is immune to revision;
every recalcitrant observation,
such that is not compatible with existing knowledge,
affects the whole system of knowledge
due to the interconnections between its parts.

{{< figure src="logo_with_description.png" title=" Schematic depiction of Quine's confirmation holism. <br><sub>While core components of the web of knowledge are more stable than those closer to the periphery, the system faces sense data as a whole and any of its components can be subject to revision. The borders between the sub-domains of science are fuzzy and incoming evidence can have an influence to all layers.</sub>" numbered="true" >}}

Even logic can be revised
if that is required for the stability of the system as a whole.
The sentiment behind the idea can be appreciated in a metaphor attributed to
[Otto Neurath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Neurath)
([Jordi 2018][2])
and popularized by Quine:

> We are like sailors who have to rebuild their ship on the open sea,
without ever being able to dismantle it in dry-dock
and reconstruct it from its best components.

The consequence arising from Quine's ideas is that
we must use the tools of science to evaluate and understand
how we come to knowledge
rather than relying on metaphysical assumptions.

I have devoted my scientific career so far
in studying how the brain acquires simple knowledge.
Furthermore,
I am convinced of
the inter-dependence of philosophy and the scientific disciplines,
and strive to bring together in my work different approaches to
understanding and shaping the world.

This blog is a dedication to this effort.
